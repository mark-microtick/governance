**Issue at hand:**
Currently the only way for everyone to interact with the Microtick environment is through the command line interface. This creates friction and entry barriers for potential users and delegators. In addition delegation & undelegation becomes unduly cumbersome.

**Solution:**
Microtick can aim at integrating with cosmoscan that works quite well. Many projects on Cosmos SDK are using it currently. It also has built in integration with hardware wallets. This will enable new delegators to enter the ecosystem fast.
